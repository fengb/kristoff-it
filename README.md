### Hi, I'm Loris! ðŸ‘‹
I studied Computer Science (Bioinformatics) in Milan (Italy), then I worked in academia on data science problems for a while. I consulted for fintech startups in Singapore, joined Redis Labs as a Developer Advocate for a while, and I'm now VP of Community at the [Zig Software Foundation](https://ziglang.org).

You can find opinionated articles on my [personal blog](https://kristoff.it), like "[Why Go and not Rust?](https://kristoff.it/blog/why-go-and-not-rust/)", a fan favorite.

I livecode regularly [on Twitch](https://twitch.tv/kristoff_it) and I'm the creator and host of [Zig SHOWTIME](https://zig.show)!

I'm currently sustaining myself through my work for the Zig Software Foundation, but I wouldn't mind one day to become fully independent and focus more on fun stuff, like Zig SHOWTIME. If you like what I do, consider becoming a GitHub Sponsor for the ZSF first, and for me second.
